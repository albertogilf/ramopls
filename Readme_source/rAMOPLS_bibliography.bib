abstract = {Many experimental factors may have an impact on chemical or biological systems. A thorough investigation of the potential effects and interactions between the factors is made possible by rationally planning the trials using systematic procedures, i.e. design of experiments. However, assessing factors' influences remains often a challenging task when dealing with hundreds to thousands of correlated variables, whereas only a limited number of samples is available. In that context, most of the existing strategies involve the ANOVA-based partitioning of sources of variation and the separate analysis of ANOVA submatrices using multivariate methods, to account for both the intrinsic characteristics of the data and the study design. However, these approaches lack the ability to summarise the data using a single model and remain somewhat limited for detecting and interpreting subtle perturbations hidden in complex Omics datasets.In the present work, a supervised multiblock algorithm based on the Orthogonal Partial Least Squares (OPLS) framework, is proposed for the joint analysis of ANOVA submatrices. This strategy has several advantages: (i) the evaluation of a unique multiblock model accounting for all sources of variation; (ii) the computation of a robust estimator (goodness of fit) for assessing the ANOVA decomposition reliability; (iii) the investigation of an effect-to-residuals ratio to quickly evaluate the relative importance of each effect and (iv) an easy interpretation of the model with appropriate outputs. Case studies from metabolomics and transcriptomics, highlighting the ability of the method to handle Omics data obtained from fixed-effects full factorial designs, are proposed for illustration purposes. Signal variations are easily related to main effects or interaction terms, while relevant biochemical information can be derived from the models.},

abstract = {The human adrenal cell line H295R constitutes a well-established model to evaluate potential alterations of steroidogenic pathways as a result of chemical exposure. However, to date most assays are based on the targeted investigation of a limited number of steroid hormones, thus preventing in-depth mechanistic interpretation with respect to steroidogenesis. In that context, analytical strategies coupling liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) have been reported as promising methods for an extended monitoring of steroid metabolites. However, unwanted sources of variability occurring during the acquisition process, including batch effects, may prevent relevant biochemical information to be properly highlighted. Dedicated data mining strategies are therefore needed to overcome these limitations, and extract relevant extended steroidomic profiles. The present study combines an untargeted LC-HRMS acquisition strategy with automated steroid metabolite annotation based on accurate mass and isotopic patterns, and a chemometric tool allowing the different sources of variability to be decomposed based on experimental design. This workflow was applied to the extended monitoring of steroidogenic dysregulations due to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) exposure in H295R cell cultures. A series of six chemicals, including acetyl tributylcitrate, octyl methoxycinnamate, torcetrapib, forskolin, linuron, and octocrylene, and dimethylsulfoxide as solvent control, were investigated through the simultaneous monitoring of 130 potential steroid metabolites, repeating the whole experiment independently three times. A stratified subsampling strategy was carried out to remove efficiently systematic batch variations and highlight subgroups of chemicals with similar steroid patterns. The proposed approach was reported as a potent screening strategy, as it allowed specific alterations of the steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism related to distinct mechanisms of action to be distinguished.},

abstract = {This work introduces a strategy for decomposing variable contributions within the data obtained from structured metabolomic studies. This approach was applied in the context of an in vitro human neural model to investigate biochemical changes related to neuroinflammation. Neural cells were exposed to the neuroinflammatory toxicant trimethyltin at different doses and exposure times. In the frame of an untargeted approach, cell contents were analysed using HILIC hyphenated with HRMS. Detected features were annotated at level 1 by comparison against a library of standards, and the 126 identified metabolites were analysed using a recently proposed chemometric tool dedicated to multifactorial Omics datasets, namely, ANOVA multiblock OPLS (AMOPLS). First, the total observed variability was decomposed to highlight the contribution of each effect related to the experimental factors. Both the dose of trimethyltin and the exposure time were found to have a statistically significant impact on the observed metabolic alterations. Cells that were exposed for a longer time exhibited a more mature and differentiated metabolome, whereas the dose of trimethyltin was linked to altered lipid pathways, which are known to participate in neurodegeneration. Then, these specific metabolic patterns were further characterised by analysing the individual variable contributions to each effect. AMOPLS was highlighted as a useful tool for analysing complex metabolomic data. The proposed strategy allowed the separation, quantitation and characterisation of the specific contribution of the different factors and the relative importance of every metabolite to each effect with respect to the total observed variability of the system.},

abstract = {Metabolomics experiments involve the simultaneous detection of a high number of metabolites leading to large multivariate datasets and computer-based applications are required to extract relevant biological information. A high-throughput metabolic fingerprinting approach based on ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and high resolution time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) was developed for the detection of wound biomarkers in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. High-dimensional data were generated and analysed with chemometric methods.Besides, machine learning classification algorithms constitute promising tools to decipher complex metabolic phenotypes but their application remains however scarcely reported in that research field. The present work proposes a comparative evaluation of a set of diverse machine learning schemes in the context of metabolomic data with respect to their ability to provide a deeper insight into the metabolite network involved in the wound response. Standalone classifiers, i.e. J48 (decision tree), kNN (instance-based learner), SMO (support vector machine), multilayer perceptron and RBF network (neural networks) and Naive Bayes (probabilistic method), or combinations of classification and feature selection algorithms, such as Information Gain, RELIEF-F, Correlation Feature-based Selection and SVM-based methods, are concurrently assessed and cross-validation resampling procedures are used to avoid overfitting.This study demonstrates that machine learning methods represent valuable tools for the analysis of UPLC-TOF/MS metabolomic data. In addition, remarkable performance was achieved, while the models' stability showed the robustness and the interpretability potential. The results allowed drawing attention to both temporal and spatial metabolic patterns in the context of stress signalling and highlighting relevant biomarkers not evidenced with standard data treatment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Bushel2007,
abstract = {Background: Commonly employed clustering methods for analysis of gene expression data do not directly incorporate phenotypic data about the samples. Furthermore, clustering of samples with known phenotypes is typically performed in an informal fashion. The inability of clustering algorithms to incorporate biological data in the grouping process can limit proper interpretation of the data and its underlying biology. Results: We present a more formal approach, the modk-prototypes algorithm, for clustering biological samples based on simultaneously considering microarray gene expression data and classes of known phenotypic variables such as clinical chemistry evaluations and histopathologic observations. The strategy involves constructing an objective function with the sum of the squared Euclidean distances for numeric microarray and clinical chemistry data and simple matching for histopathology categorical values in order to measure dissimilarity of the samples. Separate weighting terms are used for microarray, clinical chemistry and histopathology measurements to control the influence of each data domain on the clustering of the samples. The dynamic validity index for numeric data was modified with a category utility measure for determining the number of clusters in the data sets. A cluster's prototype, formed from the mean of the values for numeric features and the mode of the categorical values of all the samples in the group, is representative of the phenotype of the cluster members. The approach is shown to work well with a simulated mixed data set and two real data examples containing numeric and categorical data types. One from a heart disease study and another from acetaminophen (an analgesic) exposure in rat liver that causes centrilobular necrosis. Conclusion: The modk-prototypes algorithm partitioned the simulated data into clusters with samples in their respective class group and the heart disease samples into two groups (sick and buff denoting samples having pain type representative of angina and non-angina respectively) with an accuracy of 79{\%}. This is on par with, or better than, the assignment accuracy of the heart disease samples by several well-known and successful clustering algorithms. Following modk-prototypes clustering of the acetaminophen-exposed samples, informative genes from the cluster prototypes were identified that are descriptive of, and phenotypically anchored to, levels of necrosis of the centrilobular region of the rat liver. The biological processes cell growth and/or maintenance, amine metabolism, and stress response were shown to discern between no and moderate levels of acetaminophen-induced centrilobular necrosis. The use of well-known and traditional measurements directly in the clustering provides some guarantee that the resulting clusters will be meaningfully interpretable. copy; 2007 Bushel et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{Drotleff2019,
abstract = {Due to variation in instrument response caused by various sources of errors throughout an analytical assay, data normalization plays an indispensable role in untargeted LC-MS profiling, yet limited accepted guidelines on this topic exist. In this work, a systematic comparison of several normalization techniques, mainly focusing on internal standard-based approaches, has been performed to derive some general recommendations. For generation of untargeted lipidomic data, a comprehensive ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-quadrupole time of flight (QTOF)-MS/MS method was utilized. To monitor instrument stability and evaluate normalization performance, quality control (QC) samples, prepared from aliquots of all experimental samples, were embedded in the sequence. Stable isotope labeled standards, representing differing lipid classes, were spiked to each sample as internal standards for postacquisition normalization. Various metrics were used to compare distinct normalization strategies, with reduction of variation in QC samples being the critical requirement for acceptance of successful normalization. The comparison of intragroup coefficients of variation (CVs), median absolute deviations (MADs), and variance enables simple selection of the best performance of normalization with improved and coherent results. Furthermore, the importance for normalization in critical data sets, showing only minor effects between groups with high variation and outliers, is pointed out. Apart from normalization, also, influences of used raw data types are demonstrated. In addition, effects of various factors throughout the processing workflow were investigated and optimized. Eventually, implementation of quality control samples, even if not required for normalization, provided a useful basis for assessing data quality. Due to lack of consensus for selecting optimum normalization, suggestions for validating data integrity are given.},
